  <h1>PUT me on your fucking lists!<br>by sarah and shayhan</h1>

  After a few successful events on campus, it is becoming clear to me that the future of Palestine is something people want to talk about. Students on Brooklyn College campus care about Ahed Tamimi, students care about women in the carceral state, students care about the links between Palestine and black oppression and students care about liberation.<br><br>

When it comes to the issue of advocating for the liberation of Palestine, it’s quiet on our campus. It’s been this way ever since the infamous faculty council ‘disruption’ which the administration used as an opportunity to tarnish the name of Brooklyn College’s SJP chapter and terminate all prospects for any meaningful dialogue regarding Palestine on our campus (Chopra). In this sense, the administration at Brooklyn College campus effectively silenced the student body. After being targeted by harassment and administrative pressure, why should students feel safe to express their opinions fully? I suppose that’s the point though.<br><Br>

Closing off our borders with walls and barbed wire is the method of this school, city, state and country to make it appear as though these issues are too contentious for discussion. However, on our campus it is clear they are too contentious for mere mention. With Zionist organizations like CAMERA publicly shaming any attempts of Palestinian advocacy at Brooklyn College, it is only fair that anti-Zionist activists also get to be a part of this dialogue (CAMERA). Rather than silencing those who are advocating for the most marginalized people in our society, we should be encouraging active, passionate advocacy that isn’t hindered by bureaucracy and infringements on free speech.<br><br>

The international community has spoken with an overwhelming majority recognizing Palestine as a state: a state whose capital is Jerusalem (Al Jazeera). It is stunning to me that while the international community can make such assertions, students are fearful of backlash for sharing the sentiments of the rest of the world. This might possibly linked to the stake that CUNY and our country at large has in the upholding of the apartheid state in Israel (Action Network).<br><br>

In this way, having a sense of justice puts a target on your back. That must change. And it will change. We will have our talks, create our dialogues, and speak without fear. We will not fear being persecuted, as the fear we have as student activists is nothing compared to the fear that Palestinians who fight for their liberation must feel on a daily basis. Tell them to put us on their lists. These will be the lists that go down in history as the names who fought in the face of fear (Forward).<br><br>

Without being in solidarity with all of those who face oppression, we are nothing. I call upon the students of all races, ethnicities, religions, genders, sexualities, creeds and class: we must speak without fear and we must speak with a unified voice.<br><br>
