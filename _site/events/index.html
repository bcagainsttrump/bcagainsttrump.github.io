<h3 id="home">The moment we've been bracing for is here. Multiple news outlets are reporting that President Trump will sign an executive order today or tomorrow, restricting entry to the US from majority Muslim countries. Another executive order is also expected, attacking our undocumented neighbors with an expanded border wall and an intent to target sanctuary cities like NYC. As a city of immigrants, we cannot stay silent in the face of such hate. We ask you to gather tonight (Wednesday), to show President Trump that all New Yorkers stand with our Muslim and Latino neighbors.

Almost everyday there will be news coming out of Washington that will make us want to hit the streets again, and along with those moments there will be dozens of opportunities to march and rally and make our voices heard.

<br><br>At the same time, we need to be organizing for the long haul so that these beautiful rapid-fire mobilizations are part of an arc of resistance that keeps people engaged and coming out again and again.

<h3 id="home">On Thursday, February 2, Yemeni business owners across five New York boroughs will close 1,000 stores from 12pm to 8pm in response to the Trump administration’s infamous “Muslim Ban” executive order. This shutdown of grocery stores and bodegas will be a public show of the vital role these grocers and their families play in New York’s economic and social fabric and, during this period, grocery store owners will spend time with their families and loved ones to support each other; many of these families have been directly affected by the Ban.
<br><br>Thursday evening at 5:15pm, at Brooklyn Borough Hall, 209 Joralemon St. in the back of the building facing the plaza, the Yemeni American community will hold a rally, where some merchants will share the impact the Ban has had on them and their loved one. The program will begin with the Muslim call for prayer and a public sundown prayer by Muslim rally participants. The prayer will be followed by several Yemeni merchants and their families sharing personal stories of how their lives and families have been impacted by the ban, as well as stories read on behalf of families who are afraid to come forward.</h3></td>

<h3 id="home">On the campaign trail, Donald Trump promised a "Muslim Ban." Well, he just delivered. On January 27, Trump issued a sweeping ban, "temporarily" stopping immigration from 7 Muslim majority countries, as well as the refugee settlement program. Syrian refugees, who are among the MOST in need, have been prohibited from coming to the United States, indefintely. This will not be the only action Trump takes against Muslims, American or otherwise. It is also far from the first time Muslims have been scapegoated in this country. Our panelists, Mehreen Kasana, Moustafa Bayoumi, Arun Kundnani, and Fahd Ahmed, will talk about the roots of the Muslim Ban, what comes next, and what we can do to fight back.

<h3 id="home">A Day Without Immigrants (and immigration supporters).<br><br>

As the title of the event suggests, we, the Nation's immigrants, sons and daughters of immigrants and immigrant supporters, will be demonstrating how crucial we are to the basic fundamentals of the United States' economy. For one single day on a weekday, we must come together and unite in absolute resistance in order to reject the system dictating the launch from dehumanization and blatant oppression of those that are not straight, White, natural-born citizens.

<br><br>They don't like immigrants? Let's give them a break for one day.
<br><br>I urge you to:<br><br>
1) NOT go to work.<br>
2) NOT open your business. <br>
3) NOT make purchases at any stores, markets or online. <br>
4) NOT go out to eat. <br>
5) NOT purchase gasoline. <br>
6) NOT go to class. <br>
7) NOT send your kids to school. <br><br>
We all have bills to pay and things to do but if the system does not realize (or want to realize) how essential our daily participation is to this wonderful Country, we must paralize it in order to make our voices heard. We will stand up and we will tell them loud and clear that their precious billions of dollars are worthless without the very people they oppress and abuse to rake those profits in.
<br><br>The #RESISTANCE is now and I urge you to be a part of it. To #RESIST is to be unconformist. To #RESIST is to want a better life for ourselves, our children and all future generations. #RESISTANCE cannot happen without you.
<br><br>Do not conform. </h3></td>

Donald Trump's vicious attacks continue to dominate mainstream headlines, but the big news for the left is that socialism is re-emerging as a systemic alternative to capitalism.<br><br>

Thousands of people are asking whether it's time to join socialist organizations in order to resist Trump--and the social system that gave rise to his villainy in the first place.<br><br>

Don't sit on the sidelines and hope history turns back from the abyss. Now is the time to join the fight for a socialist future. Get involved with other socialists at Brooklyn College.<br><br>

Trump ran for president on an openly Islamophobic platform. After he was elected, he packed his cabinet with Islamophobic racists who have a long track record of courting anti-Muslim extremists. Trump’s racist travel ban on immigrants from six Muslim countries has been blocked in the courts for now. But all of this has resulted in a dangerous wave of Islamophobic hate crimes, the largest number recorded in the US since 9/11.

<br><br>We need to stand up to Islamophobia wherever it emerges. But doing so also means challenging the war on terror. For 16 years Republicans and Democrats alike have stoked anti-Muslim fears and bigotry to try and justify endless war.

<br><br>Join us for a discussion about how to understand the roots of Islamophopbia, how we can better defend ourselves against racist attacks, and how to build an alternative based on the politics solidarity.

<h3 id="home">After the initial shock of Trump's election, there has been no shortage of resistance to Trump's reactionary agenda. We took to the streets in massive numbers proving Trump has no mandate at the Women's March. We protested in airports across the country in opposition to Trump's bigoted executive orders targeting Muslims and the undocumented.<br><br>

As we organize at Brooklyn College for the battles to come, we have to ask the question: what kind of movement would it really take to bring down Donald Trump?<br><br>

To answer this, it's worth looking back for decades to the last–and only–time a president was forced to resign. What lessons can we learn from the social movements of the 1960's? What role did they play in compelling Nixon to leave office in a disgrace in 1974? And how can this history help us build a stronger fight today? Join us for discussion! <br><br>

<h3 id="home">Since 2005, people’s organizations have been organizing at Union Square for all workers. May Day, or International Workers Day, is a day of great significance to the workers and the oppressed masses across the world.<br><br>

Our main call this year is SHUT IT DOWN! Strike to Defend Migrants, Refugees, and All Workers! We have seen an attack on our people from President Trump’s Executive Orders to ban Muslims and refugees. There have already been over 1,000 civilian deaths in March 2017 by U.S. military airstrikes in Iraq and Syria, an increase of 5,000 Border Patrol officers and 10,000 ICE agents, and a proposed addition of $54 Billion USD to the national military budget. We cannot allow this to continue.<br><br>

The organizations that are putting together May Day @ Union Square 2017 are not only resisting Trump but holding the whole corrupt system accountable. We are groups coming together representing Black, Brown, People of Color, Trans, LGBTQGNC, Migrant, Muslim, People with Criminal Convictions, and Indigenous communities who are uniting to defend our people!<br><br>

We would like to enlist your support for this call to show the people on May 1st, 2017 that New York City has had enough. We are going to show the world that the people are ready for a mass movement that will lead to revolutionary change.

<h3 id="home">Dear friends,<br><br>
In recent months we have seen a dramatic escalation in attacks and violence perpetrated against immigrants, Muslims, and people of color. Last week’s horrific violence in Portland in which two people were killed and one severely injured while defending two women of color, one of whom was wearing a hijab, is only the most recent attack as a result of a growing right-wing.<br><br>

On June 10th, alt-right activists are organizing a so called "March Against Sharia" which will only serve to further embolden this kind of violence. This racism and bigotry must be confronted. We must take action to drive out racism and Islamophobia from our city. Mass mobilization and solidarity are the only way to stop the right-wing from growing and to defend those of us who are targeted by right wing violence.<br><br>

The International Socialist Organization in NYC is working with the Jewish Social Justice Contingent (Jews for Racial and Economic Justice, Jewish Voices for Peace-NYC, Network Against Islamophobia, Jews Say No!), Bay Ridge for Social Justice and the Arab-American Association of NY to build the mass rally in City Hall Park called by NYC Loves Muslims and CAIR-NY. We will gather together at 10am at the Broadway side of City Hall to say:<br><br>
NO to Islamophobia and anti-Arab racism!<br>
NO to white supremacy!<br>
YES to building community and protecting one another!<br>
YES to dignity and justice for all communities!<br><br>

We also invite you to join the ISO contingent, which will be gathering at 9:30am at the triangular park/median just north of Chambers where Hudson and West Broadway meet. We will be assembling signs and materials and shortly before 10am we will march together to join the demonstration. We need to stand up to the right-wing bigots, but just as urgently we need to build a left that can provide an alternative explanation for the sickness of our system - an alternative based on solidarity and a vision for a better world rather than scapegoating and despair. <br><br>

Trump & Pence have viciously attacked LGBTQ people from the start. They've imposed the transgender "bathroom law" preventing trans children in schools from using the bathrooms that correspond with their gender identity. Pence has expressed support for "conversion therapy"--effectively torture for gay children. The regime is enabling, even encouraging, businesses and schools (see Betsy DeVos) to discriminate against LGBTQ people. And they have unleashed a rabid fascist support base to attack anyone who doesn't conform to their white, male, heterosexual vision for America and the world. <br><br>

What does it mean to have PRIDE in Trump's America? What about Pence? In the midst of what we're facing, Pride means DEFIANCE. Pride means RESISTANCE. Pride means REFUSING to accept a fascist America. <br><br>

<h3 id="home">We have seen, all too chillingly, the impact the Trump presidency has had on an emboldened and rebranded "alt-right". Charlottesville has exposed the nature of these organized racists who aim to enact violence against people of color, activists, and anyone who stands in their way. While mourning the life of Heather Heyer, we must redouble our commitment to stopping these murderers in their tracks. We need to unite every organization and every individual in the shared goal of marginalizing their message, halting their efforts at organizing, and refusing to accept the normalization of Nazis in the streets.<br><br>

Tens of thousands have rallied against the right since Charlottesville. We have another upcoming opportunity to stake our ground next weekend. Berkeley, which has been at the center of right wing mobilizations since the election, is calling for a day of solidarity actions as a broad, united front of trade unions and political and faith-based organizations seek to counter a far-right provocation. Now is the time to take up the call. There is a renewed opening in the aftermath of Charlottesville to unite tens of thousands across the country against racism, against fear, and against fascist mobilizations. <br><br>

Let's take this opportunity to build as large and broad a demonstration as we can here in NYC on August 27th. This is a crucial next step in better organizing our side, and to take on the fights against racism, xenophobia, Islamophobia, anti-semitism and all the forms of oppression and hatred stoked by the Trump regime. Showing in numbers that these forces are not welcome is the only way to demoralize and isolate them. This is an urgent task.<br><br>

<h3 id="home">In 2012, thousands of young immigrants won the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program by courageously taking to the streets and sitting in in the corridors of power, putting themselves at risk of arrest and deportation.
<br><br>

Now, five year later, Donald Trump has threatened to end DACA and throw nearly one million young migrants' lives into disarray. The president once again ratchets up cruelty and cynicism, to promote an agenda of scapegoating and fear. But there is widespread support for DREAMERs in this country - a new Politico poll found that 84 percent of Democrats, 74 percent of independents and 69 percent of Republicans want the DREAMers to be allowed to stay in the country.<br><br>

Beyond the 800,000 DACA recipients that this overtun impacts, there are 11 million more immigrants in this country who are subject to harrassment, wage theft and deportation. Too often one section of the immigrant population is pitted against the other and a dichotomy of a "good" immigrant who deserves to be in the U.S. gets held up against the so called "bad" immigrant who doesn't do things legaly and is a "criminal." We need to reject this logic. It only serves to narrow and limit what is considered realistic legislation.<br><br>

Our starting point is that there should amnesty for all. People don't migrate and turn their lives upsideown for no reason. Immigration happens because imperialism and economic conditions (usually caused by U.S. policy) force people to seek safer lives that will allow them to feed themselves and their children.<br><br>

The DREAMers who won DACA under the Obama presidency, and the one day strike of 1 million immigrant workers on the day without an immigrant in 2006, point the way forward. Marches, sit-ins, campaigns around families seeking sanctuary - like the corageous example of Amanda Morales who is currently seeking sanctuary with her three children at the Holyrood Church in Washington Heights - and sit-ins are the way that immigrants and their supporters have succesffully pushed back against deportations.<br><br>

There is a real urgency today to build on those examples and to hightlight every campaign to ensure that the 800,000 DACA recipients stay - not at the expense of more border walls and more deportations, but as a way to build power to demand even more.</h3></td>

<h3 id="home">The election of Donald J. Trump, an inexperienced and unpredictable billionaire real estate mogul endorsed by the Ku Klux Klan, stunned the world.  Within hours of Hillary Clinton conceding the election to Trump, thousands took to the streets in protest against the victory of a candidate who lost the popular vote by the largest margin of an Electoral College winner in the nation’s history – nearly three million votes.  Trump is a right-wing populist whose message against trade deals that have hurt American workers strongly resonated in white communities where the declining power of trade unions has left people vulnerable to his bigoted and xenophobic appeals.  The complex dynamics of our social movement and populist era, the intricate (and poorly understood) connections between movements and electoral politics, and what the Trump presidency means for American democracy are the themes of our conference.

Todd Chretien, editor "Eyewitness to the Russian Revolution"<br>
Megan Behrent, author "Literacy and Revolution" (Education and Capitalism) <br><br>

Perhaps no event of the 20th Century is more controversial than the Russian Revolution of 1917. Maligned by mainstream historians as a coup, for socialists it stands as the greatest uprising of workers and the oppressed in the history of class society. <br><br>

For a brief period, the potential of humanity shone above the horror of World War I and capitalism's many miseries. The new socialist state tore apart class, religious and gender oppression; ended the war; granted land to the peasantry; and democratized the economy. Inspiring a wave of rebellions across Europe, the revolution echoed as far as Asia and America, shifting the direction of the left for generations.  <br><br>

Unfortunately, alone in a sea of imperialist enemies, Russia was starved and isolated. Democracy gave way to bureaucratization, freedom to repression. The Stalinist counter-revolution stole the mantle of the workers' revolution to pursue it's own imperial ends.<br><br>

  <i>It is true that not everyone who has experienced sexual assault or harassment feels like they can say #MeToo. For every woman who can, we will never know how many can't or won't. But if we never break the silence, there will never be room for them to speak. #MeToo is a moment of spontaneous, collective bravery. Something that is usually impossible for us to say aloud has been made possible because of mass solidarity. This is a first, and hopefully, a beginning.  -- Mia Sanders</i><br><br>
  Join the Brooklyn College Socialists and the Sociology Club to talk about what it will take to change the way sexual assault and harassment shape every aspect of our lives, and how we can turn this moment into a movement.<br><br>

  <td>Take the Knee: The Fight to Make Black Lives Matter<br>

<h3 id="home">One year ago, Colin Kaepernick sat and then took a knee during the NFL pre-season, with this statement, “I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color…. There are bodies in the street and people getting paid leave and getting away with murder.” Kaepernick launched a national struggle to make Black lives matter, shaking up a nation and withstanding attack in the Trump era, by highlighting the gap between what we are told the flag represents and the lived and historic experience of people in this country.<br><br>

Come to a discussion on how we can keep alive this struggle, on and off the playing field, and how we can make it grow.</h3></td>

<h3 id="home">The 2016 election and its aftermath has exacerbated a political climate that was already inimical to academic
freedom. We have recently seen legislative and gubernatorial attacks on individual faculty members, course
offerings, governing boards, the institution of tenure, and, generally, the institutional autonomy of colleges and
universities. Websites such as Professor Watchlist are monitoring activities of faculty members and denouncing
departures from what they view as acceptable. These activities have led to targeted harassment of faculty members.
This presentation provides an overview of the concept of academic freedom, recent attacks on academic freedom,
and how you can defend academic freedom.<br><br>

Hans-Joerg Tiede is a senior program officer in the Department of Academic Freedom, Tenure, and
Governance at the American Association of University Professors. He is the editor of Policy Documents and Reports
(the AAUP “Redbook”) (Johns Hopkins University Press, 2015) and author of University Reform: The Founding of
the American Association of University Professors (Johns Hopkins University Press, 2015).</tr>

<h3 id="home"><a href="https://www.ctctogether.org/">Changing the Conversation Together</a> is a group of concerned citizens using the evidence-based strategy of 'Deep Canvassing' to defeat Donald Trump and his Republican supporters. Deep canvassing is an empathic, listening-based method that leads to respectful conversation. It is also arguably the most effective form of voter persuasion. By listening to voters’ stories and sharing their own, deep canvassers humbly invite voters to help pull the country back from the brink. You can read articles about it from the NY Times, New Yorker, or watch a TedTalk on <a href="https://www.ctctogether.org/">CTC's website.</a><br><br>

CTC is focusing on flipping congress in 2018 and on defeating the Trump presidency in 2020. Currently CTC has been field testing its work in the only contested congressional race in New York City, NY 11. This district, currently represented by Republican Dan Donovan, includes Staten Island and south Brooklyn. <br><br>

We are currently looking for activists and other potential allies in south Brooklyn, and areas nearby. And as a son of a retired BC professor, I couldn't help but think Brooklyn College might be a good place to reach out to.<br><br>

We've parlor meetings, and informational sessions coming up this week:<br>
Thursday, 2.8, Parlor Meeting (friend raiser fundraiser) Brooklyn Heights. 530-730 PM<br>

#CUNYFirstOrCuomoFirst ?<br><br>

Join us on March 12th for a rally to demand that the Board of Trustees serve CUNY first, not Cuomo first.<br><br>

Cuomo and the CUNY Board of Trustees are scared. They are scared of what will happen when students, workers and communities unite to defend public higher education. On Monday, March 12th we have an opportunity to show them what that looks like.<br><br>

We Demand fully funded CUNY that includes:<br><br>

-Adequate funding for maintenance and emergency infrastructure funding to compensate for the Governor's continual veto of the Maintenance of Effort Bill<br>
-A student activity fee under democratic student control<br>
- A pledge to no tuition hikes and a return to truly free tuition (looking at you, Excelsior scholarship)<br>
- 7K per course compensation for adjuncts and adequate pay for all faculty and staff.<br><br>

We are all united in our struggles <br><br>

Whether you are a student, staff member or Community member, join us to stand up for student democracy on Monday, March 12th:<br><br>

Rally: 3:30 pm Bedford Avenue Entrance to Brooklyn College, East Side of Bedford avenue (on sidewalk outside gate, Library side) - Speakers to be announced.<br><br>

Then March to the Hearing which begins at 4:30 at the Gold Room in the Student Center 2705 Campus Road (at Amersfort Place) Brooklyn, New York 11210<br><br>

 <h3 id="home">Democracy is under attack at CUNY.<br><br>


On Monday March 12th the Board of trustees will consider changes to the student activity fee that would drastically restrict the way that the fee can be used on all CUNY campuses, eliminating vital services and programs and ultimately silencing the student voice!<br><br>


At the same meeting the Board will be considering a hike in tuition fees for a number of masters programs, further closing the door to postgraduate study for low-income students and communities of color.<br><br>


This timing is not a coincidence. In a year when Cuomo is proposing an austerity budget the Board of Trustees will claim they have no choice but to implement cuts to an already starved CUNY system.<br><br>


The attack on the student activity fee is an attempt to silence opposition, and we won’t stand for it. Join us on March 12th for a rally to demand that the Board of Trustees keep the student activity fee under student control! Click here to RSVP<br><br>


But this attack also reveals something, Cuomo and his Board of Trustees are scared. They are scared of what will happen when students, workers and communities unite to defend public higher education. On Monday, March 12th we have an opportunity to show them what that looks like.<br><br>
