<h3 id="home">The moment we've been bracing for is here. Multiple news outlets are reporting that President Trump will sign an executive order today or tomorrow, restricting entry to the US from majority Muslim countries. Another executive order is also expected, attacking our undocumented neighbors with an expanded border wall and an intent to target sanctuary cities like NYC. As a city of immigrants, we cannot stay silent in the face of such hate. We ask you to gather tonight (Wednesday), to show President Trump that all New Yorkers stand with our Muslim and Latino neighbors.

Almost everyday there will be news coming out of Washington that will make us want to hit the streets again, and along with those moments there will be dozens of opportunities to march and rally and make our voices heard.

<br><br>At the same time, we need to be organizing for the long haul so that these beautiful rapid-fire mobilizations are part of an arc of resistance that keeps people engaged and coming out again and again.

<h3 id="home">On Thursday, February 2, Yemeni business owners across five New York boroughs will close 1,000 stores from 12pm to 8pm in response to the Trump administration’s infamous “Muslim Ban” executive order. This shutdown of grocery stores and bodegas will be a public show of the vital role these grocers and their families play in New York’s economic and social fabric and, during this period, grocery store owners will spend time with their families and loved ones to support each other; many of these families have been directly affected by the Ban.
<br><br>Thursday evening at 5:15pm, at Brooklyn Borough Hall, 209 Joralemon St. in the back of the building facing the plaza, the Yemeni American community will hold a rally, where some merchants will share the impact the Ban has had on them and their loved one. The program will begin with the Muslim call for prayer and a public sundown prayer by Muslim rally participants. The prayer will be followed by several Yemeni merchants and their families sharing personal stories of how their lives and families have been impacted by the ban, as well as stories read on behalf of families who are afraid to come forward.</h3></td>

<h3 id="home">On the campaign trail, Donald Trump promised a "Muslim Ban." Well, he just delivered. On January 27, Trump issued a sweeping ban, "temporarily" stopping immigration from 7 Muslim majority countries, as well as the refugee settlement program. Syrian refugees, who are among the MOST in need, have been prohibited from coming to the United States, indefintely. This will not be the only action Trump takes against Muslims, American or otherwise. It is also far from the first time Muslims have been scapegoated in this country. Our panelists, Mehreen Kasana, Moustafa Bayoumi, Arun Kundnani, and Fahd Ahmed, will talk about the roots of the Muslim Ban, what comes next, and what we can do to fight back.

<h3 id="home">A Day Without Immigrants (and immigration supporters).<br><br>

As the title of the event suggests, we, the Nation's immigrants, sons and daughters of immigrants and immigrant supporters, will be demonstrating how crucial we are to the basic fundamentals of the United States' economy. For one single day on a weekday, we must come together and unite in absolute resistance in order to reject the system dictating the launch from dehumanization and blatant oppression of those that are not straight, White, natural-born citizens.

<br><br>They don't like immigrants? Let's give them a break for one day.
<br><br>I urge you to:<br><br>
1) NOT go to work.<br>
2) NOT open your business. <br>
3) NOT make purchases at any stores, markets or online. <br>
4) NOT go out to eat. <br>
5) NOT purchase gasoline. <br>
6) NOT go to class. <br>
7) NOT send your kids to school. <br><br>
We all have bills to pay and things to do but if the system does not realize (or want to realize) how essential our daily participation is to this wonderful Country, we must paralize it in order to make our voices heard. We will stand up and we will tell them loud and clear that their precious billions of dollars are worthless without the very people they oppress and abuse to rake those profits in.
<br><br>The #RESISTANCE is now and I urge you to be a part of it. To #RESIST is to be unconformist. To #RESIST is to want a better life for ourselves, our children and all future generations. #RESISTANCE cannot happen without you.
<br><br>Do not conform. </h3></td>

Donald Trump's vicious attacks continue to dominate mainstream headlines, but the big news for the left is that socialism is re-emerging as a systemic alternative to capitalism.<br><br>

Thousands of people are asking whether it's time to join socialist organizations in order to resist Trump--and the social system that gave rise to his villainy in the first place.<br><br>

Don't sit on the sidelines and hope history turns back from the abyss. Now is the time to join the fight for a socialist future. Get involved with other socialists at Brooklyn College.<br><br>

Trump ran for president on an openly Islamophobic platform. After he was elected, he packed his cabinet with Islamophobic racists who have a long track record of courting anti-Muslim extremists. Trump’s racist travel ban on immigrants from six Muslim countries has been blocked in the courts for now. But all of this has resulted in a dangerous wave of Islamophobic hate crimes, the largest number recorded in the US since 9/11.

<br><br>We need to stand up to Islamophobia wherever it emerges. But doing so also means challenging the war on terror. For 16 years Republicans and Democrats alike have stoked anti-Muslim fears and bigotry to try and justify endless war.

<br><br>Join us for a discussion about how to understand the roots of Islamophopbia, how we can better defend ourselves against racist attacks, and how to build an alternative based on the politics solidarity.

<h3 id="home">After the initial shock of Trump's election, there has been no shortage of resistance to Trump's reactionary agenda. We took to the streets in massive numbers proving Trump has no mandate at the Women's March. We protested in airports across the country in opposition to Trump's bigoted executive orders targeting Muslims and the undocumented.<br><br>

As we organize at Brooklyn College for the battles to come, we have to ask the question: what kind of movement would it really take to bring down Donald Trump?<br><br>

To answer this, it's worth looking back for decades to the last–and only–time a president was forced to resign. What lessons can we learn from the social movements of the 1960's? What role did they play in compelling Nixon to leave office in a disgrace in 1974? And how can this history help us build a stronger fight today? Join us for discussion! <br><br>

<h3 id="home">The NYC Organizing Table for the April 29th March for Climate, Jobs and Justice in Washington, DC. is grounded in several core principles:<br><br>
- Seek to strengthen the work of community groups and constituency based organizations as they take up the fight for climate justice.<br>
- Bring together different parts of our movement to help expand all of our work and bring greater coherence to our common efforts.<br>
- Pressure policy makers in our city and state to take bold steps toward reducing and eliminating carbon emissions, especially in this era of Trump.</h3></td>

<h3 id="home">Before the workday starts, Make the Road New York is hosting a march through Midtown East to call out large corporate entities that stand to profit from Trump's agenda, including backers of private prisons and immigrant detention centers like JP Morgan Chase and Wells Fargo. Ahead of the action, Make the Road today launched a "name and shame" website, with information about each company's affiliations to the Trump Administration and contact information for CEOs and Board Members.

<h3 id="home">Since 2005, people’s organizations have been organizing at Union Square for all workers. May Day, or International Workers Day, is a day of great significance to the workers and the oppressed masses across the world.<br><br>

Our main call this year is SHUT IT DOWN! Strike to Defend Migrants, Refugees, and All Workers! We have seen an attack on our people from President Trump’s Executive Orders to ban Muslims and refugees. There have already been over 1,000 civilian deaths in March 2017 by U.S. military airstrikes in Iraq and Syria, an increase of 5,000 Border Patrol officers and 10,000 ICE agents, and a proposed addition of $54 Billion USD to the national military budget. We cannot allow this to continue.<br><br>

The organizations that are putting together May Day @ Union Square 2017 are not only resisting Trump but holding the whole corrupt system accountable. We are groups coming together representing Black, Brown, People of Color, Trans, LGBTQGNC, Migrant, Muslim, People with Criminal Convictions, and Indigenous communities who are uniting to defend our people!<br><br>

We would like to enlist your support for this call to show the people on May 1st, 2017 that New York City has had enough. We are going to show the world that the people are ready for a mass movement that will lead to revolutionary change.

<h3 id="home">We are a coalition of immigrant rights groups, labor, faith and allied organizations coming together to say in one voice that we stand together and we resist together. We demand that President Trump end his attacks on our immigrant, refugees and Muslim communities. We demand good jobs and the right to organize. We demand Congress pass a federal budget that reflects our priorities, that doesn’t include a single dollar for a border wall or unjust immigration enforcement.
