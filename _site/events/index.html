<h3 id="home">The moment we've been bracing for is here. Multiple news outlets are reporting that President Trump will sign an executive order today or tomorrow, restricting entry to the US from majority Muslim countries. Another executive order is also expected, attacking our undocumented neighbors with an expanded border wall and an intent to target sanctuary cities like NYC. As a city of immigrants, we cannot stay silent in the face of such hate. We ask you to gather tonight (Wednesday), to show President Trump that all New Yorkers stand with our Muslim and Latino neighbors. Together, we will form a beacon of light against the coming darkness.</h3></td>

The signing of President Trump's executive order has affected thousands – refugees seeking asylum and protection who have already been approved for visas, mothers and fathers barred from reuniting with their families, legal permanent residents being denied the ability to return to school or work, and refugees fleeing persecution being forced to return to their countries to death and violence.<br><br>

<h3 id="home">Women's Marches to the tens of thousands of people taking to airports to oppose Trump's executive orders, it's clear that more people than ever are ready to take to the streets — many of them for the first time.
Almost everyday there will be news coming out of Washington that will make us want to hit the streets again, and along with those moments there will be dozens of opportunities to march and rally and make our voices heard.

<br><br>At the same time, we need to be organizing for the long haul so that these beautiful rapid-fire mobilizations are part of an arc of resistance that keeps people engaged and coming out again and again.

<br><br>Join me and help build the NYC organizing plan for what promises to be a critically important part of building an arc of resistance to Trump: the People's Climate Movement's mobilization in Washington DC on April 29th. Click here to RSVP for our first city wide organizing meeting on Thursday.

<br><br>On April 29th, the People’s Climate Movement and the organizations who put 400,000 people in our streets two years ago at the People's Climate March will mobilize in the nation’s capital for Climate, Jobs and Justice.

<br><br>Join us in a city wide organizing meeting:

<br><br>When: Thursday, February 2nd, 6:30 to 8:30 pm
<br>Where: Auditorium at 1199SEIU - 310 West 43rd St., just west of 8th Ave.

<br><br>We’ll hear updates on the plans for this mobilization, and we’ll get to work on building the strongest effort possible here in NYC!

<h3 id="home">On Thursday, February 2, Yemeni business owners across five New York boroughs will close 1,000 stores from 12pm to 8pm in response to the Trump administration’s infamous “Muslim Ban” executive order. This shutdown of grocery stores and bodegas will be a public show of the vital role these grocers and their families play in New York’s economic and social fabric and, during this period, grocery store owners will spend time with their families and loved ones to support each other; many of these families have been directly affected by the Ban.
<br><br>Thursday evening at 5:15pm, at Brooklyn Borough Hall, 209 Joralemon St. in the back of the building facing the plaza, the Yemeni American community will hold a rally, where some merchants will share the impact the Ban has had on them and their loved one. The program will begin with the Muslim call for prayer and a public sundown prayer by Muslim rally participants. The prayer will be followed by several Yemeni merchants and their families sharing personal stories of how their lives and families have been impacted by the ban, as well as stories read on behalf of families who are afraid to come forward.</h3></td>

<h3 id="home">On the campaign trail, Donald Trump promised a "Muslim Ban." Well, he just delivered. On January 27, Trump issued a sweeping ban, "temporarily" stopping immigration from 7 Muslim majority countries, as well as the refugee settlement program. Syrian refugees, who are among the MOST in need, have been prohibited from coming to the United States, indefintely. This will not be the only action Trump takes against Muslims, American or otherwise. It is also far from the first time Muslims have been scapegoated in this country. Our panelists, Mehreen Kasana, Moustafa Bayoumi, Arun Kundnani, and Fahd Ahmed, will talk about the roots of the Muslim Ban, what comes next, and what we can do to fight back.
