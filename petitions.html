<p id="home"><a href="https://actionnetwork.org/petitions/sign-the-petition-tell-ben-carson-to-stop-trumps-housing-cuts?source=Carson201707_MTR">Sign the petition: Tell Ben Carson to stop Trump's housing cuts!:</a><br><br>Hundreds of thousands of people rely on essential Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) programs to have a decent place to call home.<br><br>

President Trump and Secretary of HUD, Dr. Ben Carson, are proposing to cut over $7 billion from HUD’s annual budget, a drastic change that will force people out of their homes and eliminate vital services. <br><br>

These cuts will be an absolute disaster for our communities. It's not too late! Sign the petition demanding #NoCuts to HUD!<br><br>

Defunding housing programs, while giving billions of dollars in tax breaks to Wall Street, is an insult to our poorest communities. It’s immoral and unjust. Instead of cutting funding to HUD, we need to fully fund it!<br><br>

Sign the petition to Secretary of HUD Ben Carson demanding that he stop Trump's cuts to HUD, and instead call for full funding of federal housing programs.<br><br>

Thank you for taking action.</p><br><br>
