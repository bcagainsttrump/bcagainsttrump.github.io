<p><i>"American political time is often rhetorically divided into before and after the attacks of September 11, 2001. In this model, “before” signals liberty and respect for individual rights while “after” brought increasing restrictions and surveillance as a result of terrorism. But this distinction both romanticizes the past and obscures some of the institutional architecture underlying the War on Terror. In fact, there’s a direct line between the pervasive infiltration of Muslim communities seen since 2001 and the militarized street-surveillance and home invasion experienced by African American communities, which has steadily escalated from the early 1980s until the present."</i> - See more at:<a href="http://www.politicalresearch.org/2016/02/09/crime-control-political-repression-from-the-war-on-drugs-to-the-war-on-terror/#sthash.zO3RJ1ZG.dpuf">Crime Control & Political Repression: From the War On Drugs To The War On Terror by Prof. Naomi Braine</a></p><br><br>
