<p><a href="https://vimeo.com/208725169">LEFT ON PEARL Preview/Trailer</a> from <a href="https://vimeo.com/user43823641">Susan Rivo</a> on <a href="https://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p>
<p>On March 6, 1971, International Women&#039;s Day marchers turned left on Pearl Street in Cambridge, seizing a Harvard University building at 888 Memorial Drive, and declaring it a Women&#039;s Center. Hundreds of women, veterans of the antiwar and civil rights movements, demanded that Harvard provide affordable housing for the Riverside community being displaced by the university&rsquo;s expansion. The occupation&nbsp;led to the founding of the longest continuously operating Community Women&rsquo;s Center in the United States and contributed to the ongoing local struggle against gentrification and for tenants&#039; rights.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
LEFT ON PEARL is a fast-paced, humorous, 55-minute documentary about a highly significant but little known chapter in the&nbsp;history of&nbsp;the&nbsp;Women&rsquo;s Liberation Movement as it emerged from the radical political ferment of the late 60s and early 70s. The film was produced and directed by Susie Rivo, edited by Iftach Shavit, shot by Lynn Weissman, and executive produced by the 888 Women&#039;s History Project.<br />
