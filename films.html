<p id="home" style="float:right">This coming Tuesday, we have another great filmmaker visiting Brooklyn College for our "Media of Resistance" screenings: Fathima Nizaruddin. A brief bio, and a poster for the event, are below, and publicity for the film is attached. Please distribute this information to your students, as Fathima is kindly joining us from overseas. It would be a fantastic opportunity for your students, and her film seems incredible. I hope to see many of you on Tuesday!<br><br>

<p><a href="https://vimeo.com/208725169">LEFT ON PEARL Preview/Trailer</a> from <a href="https://vimeo.com/user43823641">Susan Rivo</a> on <a href="https://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p>
<p>On March 6, 1971, International Women&#039;s Day marchers turned left on Pearl Street in Cambridge, seizing a Harvard University building at 888 Memorial Drive, and declaring it a Women&#039;s Center. Hundreds of women, veterans of the antiwar and civil rights movements, demanded that Harvard provide affordable housing for the Riverside community being displaced by the university&rsquo;s expansion. The occupation&nbsp;led to the founding of the longest continuously operating Community Women&rsquo;s Center in the United States and contributed to the ongoing local struggle against gentrification and for tenants&#039; rights.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
LEFT ON PEARL is a fast-paced, humorous, 55-minute documentary about a highly significant but little known chapter in the&nbsp;history of&nbsp;the&nbsp;Women&rsquo;s Liberation Movement as it emerged from the radical political ferment of the late 60s and early 70s. The film was produced and directed by Susie Rivo, edited by Iftach Shavit, shot by Lynn Weissman, and executive produced by the 888 Women&#039;s History Project.<br />
