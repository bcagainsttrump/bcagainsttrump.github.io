<h3 id="home">The moment we've been bracing for is here. Multiple news outlets are reporting that President Trump will sign an executive order today or tomorrow, restricting entry to the US from majority Muslim countries. Another executive order is also expected, attacking our undocumented neighbors with an expanded border wall and an intent to target sanctuary cities like NYC. As a city of immigrants, we cannot stay silent in the face of such hate. We ask you to gather tonight (Wednesday), to show President Trump that all New Yorkers stand with our Muslim and Latino neighbors. Together, we will form a beacon of light against the coming darkness.</h3></td>

An RSVP is not required to attend, but if you plan to attend, the PSC would appreciate an email sent to Deirdre Brill at dbrill@pscmail.org so that they have an estimate of how many people to expect.
