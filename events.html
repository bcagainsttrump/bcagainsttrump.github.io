<h3 id="home">The moment we've been bracing for is here. Multiple news outlets are reporting that President Trump will sign an executive order today or tomorrow, restricting entry to the US from majority Muslim countries. Another executive order is also expected, attacking our undocumented neighbors with an expanded border wall and an intent to target sanctuary cities like NYC. As a city of immigrants, we cannot stay silent in the face of such hate. We ask you to gather tonight (Wednesday), to show President Trump that all New Yorkers stand with our Muslim and Latino neighbors. Together, we will form a beacon of light against the coming darkness.</h3></td>

<h3 id="home">In direct coordination with the Port Authority we will be meeting outside of JFK Terminal 4 Arrivals on the outer roadway.<br><br>Holocaust Remembrance Day was Friday and today Trump's racist executive actions have already resulted in people being detained at JFK (without access to their legal representation) because of their country of origin. Let's put action behind words and meet at JFK Terminal 4 Arrivals at 6PM to hold a vigil and rally against the detentions. NO BAN, NO WALL, SANCTUARY FOR ALL! </h3>

<h3 id="home">Due to the collective efforts of advocacy groups and organizers in New York, the Federal Court for the Eastern District of New York has now issued a temporary stay halting President Donald Trump’s executive order.<br><br>

The signing of President Trump's executive order has affected thousands – refugees seeking asylum and protection who have already been approved for visas, mothers and fathers barred from reuniting with their families, legal permanent residents being denied the ability to return to school or work, and refugees fleeing persecution being forced to return to their countries to death and violence.<br><br>

WE CALL ON OUR COMMUNITIES TO KEEP UP THE MOMENTUM TO FIGHT THE REFUGEE AND MUSLIM BAN!</h3></td>

<h3 id="home">The PSC is hosting a CUNYwide meeting for students, faculty and staff who have been working on making CUNY campuses into sanctuary campuses:<br><br>The idea is to discuss where different campuses are in the creation of sanctuary campuses (including how they are defining that), what road blocks or challenges we have been confronting, and next steps at the campus and CUNY-wide level.<br><br>

An RSVP is not required to attend, but if you plan to attend, the PSC would appreciate an email sent to Deirdre Brill at dbrill@pscmail.org so that they have an estimate of how many people to expect.

<h3 id="home">We, a group of activists and concerned citizens, will be coming together for another rally at Schumer's home to demand that Schumer stand firm and rally the Democrats to stand firm.

We need them to stand strong for all the battles coming down the pike: healthcare, immigrant rights, reproductive rights, LGBTQ rights, environmental rights, supreme court, workers' rights, etc.

We will march to Schumer's home on Prospect Park West and we will deliver protein bars and weights to Schumer, so he can regain his strength.</tr>
