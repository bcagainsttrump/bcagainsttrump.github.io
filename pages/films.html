<p id="home" style="float:right">This coming Tuesday, we have another great filmmaker visiting Brooklyn College for our "Media of Resistance" screenings: Fathima Nizaruddin. A brief bio, and a poster for the event, are below, and publicity for the film is attached. Please distribute this information to your students, as Fathima is kindly joining us from overseas. It would be a fantastic opportunity for your students, and her film seems incredible. I hope to see many of you on Tuesday!<br><br>

<p id="home" style="float:right">Next week we'll have our last Tuesday afternoon screening of the semester, in WEB 214 from 12:30-2. We will have two filmmakers showing their work; one of the films, Molly Stuart's "Objector," has played in festivals worldwide, and the second, Eric Axelman's "70 Years Across the Sea: American Jews and 21st Century Zionism," is a work in progress. Both films are thematically linked through their commitment to Jewish resistance movements, broadly considered. We will also have a representative from the If Not Now movement present to answer questions.</p></div><br><br>

<p>Please send this poster around to your students! This would also be an excellent extra credit assignment-- end of term screenings tend to dwindle in attendance, so your encouragement would be highly appreciated. This might be an especially good fit for students working on documentary, feminism, and media activism.<br><br>

There is also a facebook event that you can distribute, linked here: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/692840497575067">https://www.facebook.com/events/692840497575067</a><br>
 Please distribute this to your students as well.<br><br>

Hope to see many of you at the screening next week!</p>

<p><a href="https://vimeo.com/208725169">LEFT ON PEARL Preview/Trailer</a> from <a href="https://vimeo.com/user43823641">Susan Rivo</a> on <a href="https://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p>
<p>On March 6, 1971, International Women&#039;s Day marchers turned left on Pearl Street in Cambridge, seizing a Harvard University building at 888 Memorial Drive, and declaring it a Women&#039;s Center. Hundreds of women, veterans of the antiwar and civil rights movements, demanded that Harvard provide affordable housing for the Riverside community being displaced by the university&rsquo;s expansion. The occupation&nbsp;led to the founding of the longest continuously operating Community Women&rsquo;s Center in the United States and contributed to the ongoing local struggle against gentrification and for tenants&#039; rights.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
LEFT ON PEARL is a fast-paced, humorous, 55-minute documentary about a highly significant but little known chapter in the&nbsp;history of&nbsp;the&nbsp;Women&rsquo;s Liberation Movement as it emerged from the radical political ferment of the late 60s and early 70s. The film was produced and directed by Susie Rivo, edited by Iftach Shavit, shot by Lynn Weissman, and executive produced by the 888 Women&#039;s History Project.<br />

<p><a href="https://vimeo.com/244547107">Day With(out) Art 2017 trailer</a> from <a href="https://vimeo.com/visualaidsnyc">Visual AIDS</a> on <a href="https://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p>
<p>ALTERNATE ENDINGS, RADICAL BEGINNINGS is the 28th annual iteration of Visual AIDS’ longstanding Day With(out) Art project. Curated by Erin Christovale and Vivian Crockett for Visual AIDS, the video program prioritizes Black narratives within the ongoing AIDS epidemic, commissioning seven new and innovative short videos from artists Mykki Blanco, Cheryl Dunye & Ellen Spiro, Reina Gossett, Thomas Allen Harris, Kia LaBeija, Tiona Nekkia McClodden and Brontez Purnell.<br><br>

In spite of the impact of HIV/AIDS within Black communities, these stories and experiences are constantly excluded from larger artistic and historical narratives. In 2016 African Americans represented 44% of all new HIV diagnoses in the United States. Given this context, it is increasingly urgent to feature a myriad of stories that consider and represent the lives of those housed within this statistic. ALTERNATE ENDINGS, RADICAL BEGINNINGS seeks to highlight the voices of those that are marginalized within broader Black communities nationwide, including queer and trans people.<br><br>

The commissioned projects include intimate meditations of young HIV positive protagonists; a consideration of community-based HIV/AIDS activism in the South; explorations of the legacies and contemporary resonances within AIDS archives; a poetic journey through New York exploring historical traces of queer and trans life, and more. Together, the videos provide a platform centering voices deeply impacted by the ongoing epidemic.<br><br>
