  On the campaign trail, Donald Trump promised a &quot;Muslim Ban.&quot; Well, he just delivered. On January 27, Trump issued a sweeping ban, &quot;temporarily&quot; stopping immigration from 7 Muslim majority countries, as well as the refugee settlement program. Syrian refugees, who are among the MOST in need, have been prohibited from coming to the United States, indefintely. This will not be the only action Trump takes against Muslims, American or otherwise. It is also far from the first time Muslims have been scapegoated in this country.

  Our panelists are Mehreen Kasana, a journalist writing about race and religion for outlets such as The New York Times and The Los Angeles Times, Moustafa Bayoumi, professory at Brooklyn College and author of &quot;This Muslim American Life,&quot; Arun Kundnani, scholar-in-residence at the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, New York Public Library, and author of &quot;The Muslims Are Coming!&quot; and Fahd Ahmed of Desis Rising Up and Moving (DRUM). Maryam Jamshidi, Muftah&#039;s editor-in-chief, will moderate a dicussion about the roots of the Muslim Ban, what comes next, and what we can do to fight back against anti-Muslim bigotry.</p>Posted by <a href="https://www.facebook.com/muftahmagazine/">Muftah Magazine</a> on Friday, February 10, 2017</blockquote></div></p><br><br>
